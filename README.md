## 🚀 About Me
Hi there 👋, I'm Leo Mark Paway, a Junior Android Developer with 2 years of experience working with Kotlin. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which has provided me with a strong foundation in software development. Over the past two years, I've gained hands-on experience building and optimizing Android applications, focusing on developing scalable and maintainable applications. Using various architectural patterns such as MVVM and MVI, MVP as well as MVVM Clean Architecture to ensure robust and organized code. I'm eager to continue growing in this field and excited to tackle new challenges in mobile app development.
